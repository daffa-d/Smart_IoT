# Welcome To Smart IoT 

This code currently under development and refinement

Keep in mind I created my own headers to make main.cpp short and easy to understand. so when you use my code. please understand carefully

**Firebase.h** <br>
Firebase.h are the headers that are used to receive data and send data from firebase. to setup yourself change the link and authentication from your own firebase to <code>fb.begin("","") </code>

**Connection.h** <br>
Connection.h These headers are a combination of the esp8266 WiFi manager and WiFi client. all you have to do is change your wifi name and password on the <code> Connection AT() </code>

**Temp.h** <br>
